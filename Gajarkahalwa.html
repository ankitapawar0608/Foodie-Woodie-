        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Making the popular Indian dessert known as Carrot Halwa (a.k.a. Gajar Ka Halwa in Hindi or Gajrela in
            Punjabi) is so simple when you use my detailed step-by-step guide and video! Whether you make it &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;using the
            traditional stovetop method, or take some shortcuts by using milkmaid, khoya or the Instant Pot. I have you
            covered all with detailed step-by-step photos in this helpful recipe post sharing 4  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;variations or ways to
            make this decadent sweet. <br> <br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carrot halwa is a popular sweet made in North India, and it is especially popular during winters. The
            traditional gajar ka halwa recipe is made with only carrots, whole (full-fat) milk, ghee and sugar; thereâ€™s &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
            no need for khoya (evaporated milk solids) or condensed milk. <br> <br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you prefer using either khoya or milkmaid (sweetened condensed milk), skip to the appropriate section
            below to learn how! <br> <br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I prefer to use red Delhi carrots to make the halwa, as they are tender and juicy. That said, you can use
            any carrots â€“ red, orange, or even black â€“ so long as they are not fibrous, stringy, or hard. <br> <br>
